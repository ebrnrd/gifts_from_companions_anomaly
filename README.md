# gifts_from_companions_anomaly

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly mod that makes companions give you gifts from time to time.

This is my first ever mod. It's a very simple mod that doesn't modify any file so it should be compatible with lots of mods.
I haven't tested it that much but it seems to be working in GAMMA too.

The gifts are handpicked and based on the player reputation (no good gifts for naughty boys) but I'm still on the fence on how to deal with rank and reputation.
You can find and edit the gifts_tables in the gfcmod_tables.script inside the scripts folder.

The gifts_tables include handpicked game items, the categories are: FOOD, DRINK, MEDICAL, DEVICE (PDAs), TOOL, REPAIR(Repair tools for weapons and outfits), MISC (Junk) and AMMO.
I'm still working on the list, it is a tedious job and I would also like some suggestions on which items to include.

Your companions will also say a random sentence while giving you the gift, I will add more in the future, also I don't know russian, so for now these are only in english.

MCM compatibility, there are 3 settings:
min_timer: the minimum time that needs to pass before receiving another gift (seconds) (default = 300)
max_timer: the maximum time that can pass before receiving another gift (seconds) (default = 600)
gift_chance: the chance of receiving said gift when the time comes (default = 0.2)

It's still in development and considering it is my first mod it is definetly not fireproof but again, it's pretty simple so there shouldn't be many problems.
